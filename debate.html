								<h2> Why Debates are Useless </h2>
                            </header>
                                <p> Before you read the rest of this, I want you to know that the title is misleading - yet if you clicked on this article with the intent of reading what I’ve put forward and proving me wrong, you’ve already proven my point. Debate originated thousands of years ago, most probably in Athenian society or Ancient India, where Shastrartha debate would be used within philosophy and politics. While these are the two subjects in which I think debate is most necessary, I’d like to make my opinion clear: debate needs to be used for actual change. </p>

                                <p> To neutralize the feeling you got from the title, my main problem isn’t with the idea of debate as a whole -  in fact, debate is one of my favorite things to do. However, the issue I have stems from the idea of ‘competitive’ debate, where two groups, usually For and Against a specific motion, come together to argue their points. A panel of judges decides who made the strongest arguments, and that side wins. Conceptually, this seems harmless, however, I’ve recently realized that its ramifications are omnipresent upon people of all generations. Of course, this is no study, and I do not claim to be an expert on this, but there are certain trends I’ve noticed that I thought I’d write down.
                                </p>

<p> Back to my point, competitive debate seems to be harmless. In general, it actually holds many benefits to those who participate in it. Not only does it advance one’s public speaking skills, but it also develops analytical and critical thinking skills; as someone who has participated in competitive debate, I can confirm I’m a much better speaker because of it. However, here’s where it gets interesting. The notion that when entering debate, you must prove that you are correct is only applicable within competitive debate, and this is where the problem lies. Many people take this notion and apply it to other forms of debate, such as discussion over a decision, or even bigger questions, such as those of politics or philosophy, and as such, these competitive notions eventually trickle down to basic conversation.
</p>
                            <p> Here’s the kicker: In competitive debate, a debater usually does their research, and so they know what’s going on. They know the facts and the statistics, however, in general conversation, or non-competitive debate, neither party knows everything. Unfortunately, their instinct from competitive debate makes them intrinsically want to present their ideas as being correct, which they very well might not be. Hence, this competitive debate mentality leads to people believing in their thought process more than others’, which eventually leads to a very closed-minded approach to any situation.  
                            </p>

<p> In essence, what I’m trying to say is that competitive debate causes people to want to be right all the time, even when they’re not. They have such an instinctive reaction to defend their point, almost as if any slight argument or conversation is the hill they’re willing to die on, which is inherently toxic. I don’t speak from conjecture, I speak from experience. I am one of these competitive debaters who has been taught to be correct all the time, and only recently have I discovered that I can be wrong. In fact, I now take more pleasure in being wrong, because I have the opportunity to learn something or gain knowledge. A widely attributed quote has said to “never be the smartest man in the room,” and I believe that its truths are very important to understand for people like me. If you enter a conversation, or a casual debate, with the intent of winning or being triumphant, you’ve already lost. You’ve already lost, because the person whom you’ve villainized as an opponent could be teaching you something new, and you would never know - that loss of knowledge trumps any satisfaction you could ever receive from winning an argument.
