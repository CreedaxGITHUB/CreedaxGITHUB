                            </header>
                                <p> On the 29th of November, in 2003, I was born. According to those at the scene, I was born blue (...?). Whether this is an indication of a lack of oxygen, or I was literally born to play a part in James Cameron's Avatar, I can't tell you.
                                Not because I don't want to, but seeing as I still haven't been contacted by the Avatar 2 team, I'm inclined to say it wasn't the latter. I was born in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia, but I am a Jordanian citizen. Unlike my siblings, I was fortunate enough not to move around too often. I spent the majority of my early life
                                in Saudi Arabia, moved to Jordan for a year, and ever since, I've been living in Dubai, UAE. I've been here in Dubai for almost 12 years at the time of writing this, and it's been very interesting. Living here? It's a completely different dynamic than anywhere else I've been, but I can't complain.
                                </p>

                                <p> To be completely honest, I don't remember much from my childhood. One particular trait that I had (and still do), was my curiosity. There were so many things around me that I just didn't understand.
                                Think about it like this: How does a microwave work? You're probably thinking "It's just electromagnetic radiation being shot at food and it makes it hot"... and that's a fair answer.
                                That's the answer I got when I asked. But really, think about it. HOW does it do what it does? When you think about it, there's just so much around you that you just don't know much about.
                                The screen you're reading this on? You've heard of pixels and the color spectrums... "You can never see true yellow!".
                                I mean, alright... But how are so many tiny lights powered? How do they work together to make images? How do the letters
                                I'm typing right now immediately translate to letters on my screen? </p>

<p> As you can imagine, this must've been awful for my parents. I can't imagine a 8 year old asking me how everything works (repeatedly, because I have terrible memory)...
That's frankly just too much. I was blessed with parents that knew what they were talking about. My dad sells stuff (...?), and my mother became an author but they knew everything I asked,.
They both studied some form of Biology in University, which has contributed to my brother studying CompSci, my sister Law, and me? Undecided. My favorite subjects are (in no particular order) Math, Physics, Computer Science, History, and English... But not Biology.
Never biology.</p>
                            <p> If this entry were an essay, the paragraph you're reading right now would be the conclusion, however it doesn't seem very fitting. A conclusion? I'm 16.
                            To say that this is the conclusion of a "Who am I?" post implicitly infers that my life ends here. I'd like to think that at some point in the future, I'll update it.
                            I'll be someone different. So consider this as a conclusion not of my life, but of who I am now.
                            </p>

                            <p> - Ibrahim Shanqiti, Towards the end of Year 11, 2020. Godspeed.</p>
