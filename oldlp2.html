								<h2> Critical Piece: Writing Style and Audience Engagement? </h2>
                            </header>
                                <p> From the beginning of the book, it is already clear that “Things Fall Apart”, written by Chinua Achebe, is
a literary classic. This is not only marked by the multiple awards listed on the back of the book, but also
by the topic and theme of the book, mentioning colonialism, and tribalism in Africa, both of which are
very important topics that have been discussed in many other subjects. My main critique of the book does
not emanate from the theme of the book. On the contrary, I found the idea of “Things Fall Apart” to be
one of the most interesting that I’ve read this year, but my critique is with the writing style of Chinua
Achebe, which I will discuss today.</p>

                                <p> Firstly, I would like to discuss the positives of the writing style and audience engagement of Chinua
Achebe's writing style, however I should define “Audience Engagement” as I intend to use it in this essay.
Audience Engagement, to me at least, is how efficient a book is at, not affecting the audience, but actually
making the audience interested in the book. Firstly, Chinua Achebe wrote his best work, when he was
describing scenery, and when he was narrating the interactions between the white colonialists, and the
native tribesmen. I feel like this was a great part of the book, and I enjoyed it thoroughly, however there
were some negatives that I felt made reading the book an unpleasant experience.</p>

<p> Frankly, Chinua Achebe’s writing style in the majority of the chapters was simply… uninteresting. He
had a tendency to skip over massive time periods in the book, and just overlook some important parts of
the story that would’ve been interesting to the reader, just to get a point across. Obviously, Achebe did not
write the book to please avid readers, but the fact is, his proneness to write in the style where he just skips
and barely narrates some events, but then delves into massive details into others makes the book
extremely difficult to read, and even harder to enjoy. By doing so, Achebe jeopardizes the reader’s
engagement, and their willingness to complete the book, which would mean that his whole argument
against colonialism would never be completely read, which defeats the entire purpose of the book.</p>


                                <p>  In conclusion, Chinua Achebe had some interesting parts of the book where the audience would be
engaged, however his propensity to undernarrate certain events, and then overnarrate others, makes
reading the book an unpleasant experience, and I’d go as far to say that due to this specific writing style, it
made the book genuinely boring. </p>
