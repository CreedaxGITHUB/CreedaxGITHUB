								<h2>Comparative Piece: How do “Things Fall Apart” and “All my Sons” portray their protagonist’s reason for suicide?</h2>
                            </header>
                                <p> Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall apart has its protagonist commit suicide by the end of the book, as does All
my Sons. Despite the fact that Okonkwo and Joe Keller are in completely different times, contexts, and
physical places around the world, the circumstances and the reason for their suicide have several
similarities and difference.</p>

                                <p> Firstly, the nature of both of the suicides is very similar. Both Okonkwo and Joe Keller had one main
reason for taking their own lives, and that same main reason was their downfall all throughout both
stories. This reason was their pride. At the beginning of the story, Okonkwo’s pride was shown through
the fact that “Okonkwo was ashamed of him [Okonkwo’s Father]”, and just the idea that Okonkwo was
ashamed of his father showed that Okonkwo was a man with pride, and he did not tolerate weaknesses.
Not only this, but his strive for success as coupled with a hatred of being seen as weak within his
community. He cared about how the public viewed him, and this eventually became his downfall.
Similarly, Joe Keller’s initial problem of selling faulty parts and blaming it on his business partner came
from his unwillingness to be seen as someone that cannot provide for their family, which meant that he
cared about how the public viewed him, which as well was a strong reason for his suicide. The reason
these both are similar because, by the end of both books, Okonkwo killed himself because he was afraid
of being seen as weak and alone when the rest of the tribes abandoned his effort against the white men.
He was so ashamed of being alone and weak, in comparison to the colonialists, that he willingly chose to
end his life, which again shows the reason for suicide. Joe Keller shot himself, because he didn’t want to
face his family after finding out that he was the indirect reason for his son’s death.</p>


                                <p> Despite the similarities, they both have fundamental differences in the reason of suicide, and how it led up
to that situation in the first place. In Things Fall Apart, Okonkwo is portrayed to have been a hero, all
throughout the story, and by the end, he would’ve been a tragic hero. It was evident that, even when he
had to kill Ikemefuna, he was regretful, all throughout the book, which highlighted his internal struggle.
The author wanted the audience to understand that Okonkwo was undergoing a character arc that
would’ve made him a better person than he initially was, and then he used Okonkwo’s suicide to rob the
audience of that character arc, leaving them on edge, but also showing Okonkwo’s tragic ending stemmed
from him wanting to be a better person. In contrast, Joe Keller was never truly shown as a tragic hero, but
a character that was victimized to both capitalism and his own hatred of appearing weak and unable to
provide for his family. Irrespective of the people that he had a hand in killing, or the man that he got
imprisoned, he only chose to end his life when he realized that his family would never see him in the
same way. Some might consider him as a tragic hero, but from what can be seen in the novel, he was
never a hero to begin with. He was a victim of his ideals, and he chose to end his life, not when he had
killed dozens of people, nor when he falsely led a man to imprisonment, which would’ve ruined his life,
but when he realized his harsh actions would be judged by his family, showing him to be weak, and he
simply could not bear that.</p>


                                <p>

                                In conclusion, both texts use similar and different techniques to portray their protagonist’s reason for
committing suicide, and each are both equally effective</p>
