								<h2> Creative Piece: Tragic Hero or Coward? </h2>
                            </header>
                                <p> By now, we’ve all read All My Sons, by Arthur Miller. The story was intriguing, and I must admit… I
finished it all in one sitting. One thought that’s been endlessly drifting around my head, space oddity
style, is this: How does one classify the main character, Joe Keller? I’ve done my own research, and I
found a lot of english teachers, or current literature enthusiasts much like you and I, that believed he was a
tragic hero, defined by Aristotle as “ a literary character who makes a judgment error that inevitably leads
to his/her own destruction”, and this particular opinion caught my attention. I strongly disagree, and in
this article, I want to show you, the audience, why I think Joe Keller is the furthest thing from a hero that
a character can be</p>

                                <p> Firstly, I’m gonna put a little “Debate Club” twist on this, and look at previously existing arguments that
say he’s a tragic hero, and debunk them. By the definition of a tragic hero, a character must make a fatal
mistake, or a judgement error, that leads to their demise. Every argument I’ve read has cited the fact that
Joe Keller made one single mistake, or his flaw, by allowing the shipment of dysfunctional goods, and
that he put his family before his country, which eventually led to his demise. I think that there has to be a
clear distinction between a flaw, or a lapse in judgement, and complete and utter evil. Personally, I find it
difficult to believe that condemning dozens to die, including his own son, doesn’t particularly fall under
the “tragic hero” type of mistake.</p>

<p> Here’s my point: Joe Keller’s “flaw” was that he was a capitalist, valuing the life of his family over
others. Not only that, but how he was viewed in the community as well. Not only did he sentence many
pilots to a gruesome death, but he also lied, therefore leading his business partner to jail. In the context of
this story, these actions simply cannot make him a hero. Besides, if Joe Keller was to kill himself either
way, he did it only after discovering that it was his son that died as an indirect result of his actions, not
when he lied to the police, or killed many pilots. And again, the reason he commit suicide was because of
how he thought his family would view him. Instead of the contemporary tragic hero, such as Danaerys
Targaryen, or Severus Snape, ranging all the way back to Hamlet, or Romeo, Joe Keller’s character and
background simply doesn’t follow the template of a tragic hero. Instead, his sick, self serving actions lead
him to extreme guilt, only when a family member dies at his hands, which goes to show that his
psychopath-like actions never served as indications towards a tragic hero, but rather the antagonist of All
My Sons.</p>
